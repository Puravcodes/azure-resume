# Azure Resume

This project showcases my resume on a personal website, with a unique feature: a view counter built with Azure Functions and C#. Each time someone views my resume, the counter increments, allowing me to track engagement. This project combines several Azure services to create a dynamic, interactive experience while hosting a static website.

## Project Workflow

Below is the workflow of the project, illustrating the interactions between each component. *(Please refer to the diagram I created for visual details)*.

## Project Description

The **Azure Resume** website is designed to present my professional experience and skills in a clean, accessible format. In addition to traditional resume content, I’ve implemented a custom-built counter in C# that increments with each page view. This project demonstrates my skills in cloud services, serverless computing, and web development.

## Azure Services Used

This project utilizes the following Azure services:

- **Azure Cosmos DB**: A NoSQL database to store the resume view count.
- **Azure Function App**: A serverless function to handle HTTP requests and increment the counter in Cosmos DB.
- **Azure Storage Account (Static Website)**: Hosts the resume website as a static site, enabling fast, reliable access without the need for a dedicated server.

Thank you for viewing my Azure Resume project! This application is a great example of how modern cloud services can enhance a personal website, and I’m excited to continue exploring more cloud-based solutions in the future.
